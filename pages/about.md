## About The Exhibit

This interactive exhibit was transcribed from a 2002 digital exhibit created by Iowa State University Library’s Special Collections Department. The original exhibit can be seen [here](https://historicexhibits.lib.iastate.edu/Morrill/intro.html). All photographic materials were taken from the university library archives, now known as [Special Collections and University Archives](https://specialcollections.lib.iastate.edu/) (SCUA). The essay, “History of the Pipe Organ in Morrill Hall Chapel”, was written by Dennis Wendell. 

The purpose of recreating this exhibit in CollectionBuilder is to make its content more discoverable and usable for current audiences. CollectionBuilder also allows readers to experience the exhibit in new ways, such as by browsing images or viewing them chronologically in a timeline. 

### Creators

This exhibit was created by Peter Kooger, a student in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Library and Information Science master’s program, and Olivia Wikle, the head of the Digital Scholarship and Initiatives department at Iowa State University Library.

### The Project

Morrill Hall: The Jewel of Iowa State was recreated in CollectionBuilder as a part of Peter Kooger’s practicum with the library’s Digital Scholarship and Initiatives department. Olivia Wikle, the head of the department, served as practicum supervisor and assisted in the creation of the project. The website was built using CollectionBuilder’s [CSV template](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/csv/).
