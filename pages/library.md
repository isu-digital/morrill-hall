## Morrill Hall: The Library

Morrill housed the library from the time it was built in 1891 until 1914, when the Library was moved to [Beardshear Hall](https://historicexhibits.lib.iastate.edu/buildings/beardshear.html). The Agricultural Extension Offices and Document Room were moved into Morrill Hall. This room was located on the first floor of the building, south of the central stairway.
